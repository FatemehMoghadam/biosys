Sites:
 * parent_site created but without information
 * col: 'Landform element code' doesn't exists in db
 * there are two columns 'Type of closest water', renamed the second and ignored data

Site Characteristics:
 * Two columns 'Distance to closest water (m)' and 'Type of closest water'. The second columns are ignored.
 * Columns 'Photos taken' and 'Historical information' are not part of the SiteCharacteristics model but the Site model.
   They look like copy of the Site datasheet.
 * lots of species doesn't validate.
 * row 2763 'Collector no' exceed the 30 max char. Extend to 200
 * condition lookup didn't have 'dead'

Stratum Species:
 * Stratum lookups were letters 'U', 'M1',... instead of the 'Upper', 'Mid 1', ... Updated the lookup fixture.
 *avg_height: sometime nothing -> relaxed the not null constraint
 *species: lots of them doesn't validate -> forced the not validate for all
 ERROR!!!
 * !!!!! They are a few sites code that doesn't exist in the site datasheet ex row#2672: LCI 305 (only LCI 305 R), same for rows 2818 ,...
   I can't create the site by default without a project.

Vegetation:
* This datasheet contains:
    GroundCoverSummary: col E to N
    TransectObservation: col O to Y (same column name!!!!)
    TransectDistinctChanges: col Z to AH with 3 rows as repeated columns !!!!!
    BasalBitterlichObservation: col AI to AK
    ErosionPeg: col AL to AW with tree rows as repeated columns (peg A,B and C)
    PegObservation: col AX to BR (7 cols per peg) and a last column not in db for comment!!
* Missing Peg IDon numerous row (ex #336)!!! Assumes A,B,C
* lots of missing transect y_direction assumes 0
MODIF!! Add column name
* The col BS (comment for peg observation) was not in the model. Added a field comment, value is repeated for all 3 pegs. A column header must be added.
ERRORS!!!
* Missing sites.

Duplicate rows for same site visit??
